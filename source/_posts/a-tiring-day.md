Today was a rather tiring day. I did not get to have much sleep last night, and it really affected my productivity at work. 

I was supposed to go to Michigan Hackers' Hack Night event today, but when I came home, lazily cooked some cheap, _healthy_ Philly Steak Hot Pocket, I just could not get up from the couch and watched two hours of Youtube. But those two hours were worth it. And now after a whole week of determining my options for setting up a blog, the cheapest option right now was with Netlify.

With Netlify, I learned about the whole programming JAMstack philosophy, where all the dependencies and stuff are all handled in the background for the developer and user, and it is a quick and simple 3 steps to deploy any project. It has really helped with my passion initiative with hosting our KUHacks Team Site, and also our team site. 

Also, for KUHacks we just had an old A-section friend of mine apply to become part of the team! I cannot wait to interview him, his react skills are going to really help with our #creators committee. 

Oh, and if it wasn't clear why I'm writing this blog, it's to really put m life in perspective and also challenge myself to have more fun days than whatever I have been doing before. Sadly, life is too short, and unless life can be prolonged in some virtual world, or we end aging, this is the reality we have to accept. 

None of that existential stuff is needed right now though, I should head to sleep before this tiring cycle continues.
