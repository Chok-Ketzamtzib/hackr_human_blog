I woke up late today, and was well rested. Originally I was going to see the new Sonic movie, but the brothers changed plans. I decided to rest more, lounging on my bed and not getting up. I finally did though out of hunger around 2 PM, cooking breakfast. I enjoyed some _delicious_ and **fresh-cooked** eggs, black beans, turkey bacon, and sausages. 

I cleaned around the entire house, and my room now looks very clean, and I am proud. I can now have a better sleep routine than what I am doing. I am still blogging late at night though, and that has to change.

I also made tortillas from scratch today for the first time, and it was fun and relaxing to do. However, the tortillas did not come out as thin as I wanted them to be, but I will have some tomorrow morning for breakfast, that is for sure.

I also forgot about the IBM coding challenge I had today, and it did not end my day well. I bombed that test, and it was also easy in hindsight, but my lack of practice and also the lack of will after forgetting about it until the last second really destroyed my morale. Add on to that the stress of other stuff I have not done yet. Project management is not my thing, and I really need to change that. 

Despite all this, I found an email software I can use for KUHacks. The email template is not done yet, but I'm hoping I can show it to my FIJI brothers at Intersection tomorrow. 

peace out, peace for all✌️
