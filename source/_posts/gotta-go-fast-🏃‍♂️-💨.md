I was supposed to wake up early this morning and wash clothes. That did not happen....

Instead, I just got changed and drove immediately to Flint to watch Sonic the Hedgehog, the Movie, with of course the newly redesigned Sonic from the monstrosity (and marketing ploy) that was shown from the original trailer. 

The movie definitely achieved its goal, as it was over as soon as it was started. Simple to follow kids movie, with all the quirks kids movies have, except there were some genuine funny moments that only adults could get, but there were still cringy Fortnite dances of course sprinkled about.

As fun as it was to watch the movie with my FIJI brothers, we were there in Flint from our co-ops to actually go to a FIJI intersection, where basically as a house with A-section brothers we decided on important stuff and budget regarding problems with our house. Before the meeting started, I decided to meet some old friends from A-section from the Phi Delta Thetas next door. Of course, we listened to some nice Jazz while talking about a cool thesis topic I could not understand regarding quantum physics and whatnot, but it really brought back some nostalgia from my first term at Kettering.

Once the intersection was over, I caught up with some A-section FIJI bros I knew before I became one, and then went to Qdoba with my B-section bros. Walking in, I decided to try their tacos, but then realized it was not worth it. I never liked Qdoba anyways, it's just not authentic, but really nothing is in Flint, and I cannot really recommend anything else. I should honestly start a taco truck there! ! 🌮🚚

Hanging out, we laughed and enjoyed our time together, in our royal purple radiance as the sunset 🌇 basked and baked our tortilla chips. Soon enough, it was 6:30 PM and I had to rush to my weekly KUHacks meeting. 

I picked up my marketing head, went to a hotel lounge with my sponsor relations head, and for an hour meeting which then turned into 2 hours, we worked on understanding where we stood with sponsors, tracks and themes for KUHacks 2020, and then realized our visions do not align. To ensure  we get stuff done, I need to basically do a work of statement, a document outlining what I expect to see out of KUHacks 2020. It does not help that we do not have a confirmed venue, so I am calling Kettering regarding that. We just really need a sponsor of some kind, as time is running out. I really need to put the vision out there, and make sure we stick together to help change Kettering for the good, for better co-ops, for learning through fun, and bringing hacker culture to a work-prone, corporate school.

That is the effect I want, but to bring a vision to life requires envisioning the path and the process, not just the end goal, or the climax of such work. 

Again, let me say it again - 

> Imagine the process, not the end

That is how you get to your goals, and that's what I am practicing from now on...

peace out, peace for all✌️
