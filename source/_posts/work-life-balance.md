## "Passion dies quickly"

This is not always the case, but today  came to work really late. Despite me going to sleep early, I woke up past the time I had to get to work. My alarms were all on, and based on my fitbit's stats, I woke up, but I do not recall even waking up. Clearly, I am just very tired, and was making up for the previous night. 

Regardless, the burden of coming in late made me really rethink where I was in life. I considered where I was in the world at that moment, how far I have come, but yet how far I have yet to reach and attain goals that seemed impossible. 

I have a lot of stress and financial troubles, and that caused me to really want to escape to other options I have in life. However, I decided just to fix what I could, by cleaning the kitchen and setting up an ergonomic station on the work desk. What I am working on at work is Angular, but it's all new and foreign to me. I seem to have issues problem-solving previous projects, and it might come down to me not asking for enough help. 

I pushed forward and worked on my blog for 5 hours, to find out I need to learn more PHP before implementing some basic, and cool CSS. It's 2AM and I am not fixing the cycle of tiredness. I just want to see the Sonic movie with my FIJI brothers tomorrow, but I will have to hope I do not oversleep now. 

peace out, peace for all✌️
