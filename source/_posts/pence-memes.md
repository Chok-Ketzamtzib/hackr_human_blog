I have not been posting as much as I should, but this past Tuesday (02/25/2020) I got to volunteer to help with Mike Pence's bus tour in Troy, Michigan. I was hoping to meet him briefly since we happen to be FIJI brothers, but as the photo shows, I did not get the chance =(



Regardless, it was a dive into the world of Trump's fans, right-winged groups, and conservatism. It was also a dive into the local politics, politicians, and people in power for the city of Troy, such as meeting Adi, Planning Commissioner of the city of Troy responsible for advancing development in Troy to where it is today. The city is much more a foodie place thanks to these advancements and makes it easy to have choice as a consumer. The architecture looks nice as well, with more modern minimalism and neutral colors, which makes Troy look more like its close neighbor, Canada. 



After standing at the door for hours though, it was tiring, and I got to get home and cook some Latke chicken, which I am not sure if I did correctly. It tasted like a 3/10, but it is manageable.
